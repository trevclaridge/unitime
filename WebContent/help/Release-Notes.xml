			<name>Funding Department</name>
			<description>
				<line>An optional funding department has been added to classes. It can be used to group the class data differently for funding reporting than it is done for course timetabling.</line>
				<line>The visibility of the funding department functionality is controlled by a property (unitime.courses.funding_departments_enabled) so it is not visible for institutions that do not use it.</line>
				<line>Finding department can be defined on multiple levels: on the subject area (for courses controlled by a course of this subject), on a course, or on an individual class.</line>
				<line>Similar to external managers, the funding department defaults to the controlling department of the class, and only departments marked as possible funding departments can be selected as additional options.</line>
				<line>A number of pages have been rewritten to GWT as part of this effort, but it is possible to switch the user interface back to the original Struts based page. See unitime.legacy.xxx properties in the Application Configuration.
					<line>These include Departments, Subject Areas, Instructor Assignment, and Add/Edit Course Offering pages.</line>

			<description>
				<line>Added ability to partition a room into multiple smaller rooms.
					<line>On the Add/Edit Room page, there is a new Partition of drop-down listing all rooms of the same building that are not partitions of some other rooms already.</line>
					<line>Non-university locations cannot be partitioned.</line>
					<line>On the Rooms page, there is a new Partitions of column (listing the parent room of room partition).</line>
				</line>
				<line>Added support for the course timetabling solver.
					<line>Parent room is unavailable when one of its partitions is occupied and vice versa (partitions cannot be used at the time when the parent class is occupied).</line>
					<line>Timetable Grid page can include:
						<line>classes from all the partitions on the parent room,</line>
						<line>classes of the parent room on each of the room partitions.</line>
						<line>This is disabled by default, enable by setting unitime.timeGrid.classesAcrossPartitions to true.</line>
					</line>
				</line>
				<line>Added support for conflict checking in the events, and for the computation and display of conflicting events.</line>
